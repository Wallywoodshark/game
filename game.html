<div id="Aboutme">
  <p id="AboutMeText"> Hello, My name is Waldo Tapia I am a rising senior at PCRHS. This is my first time coding with any coding language. I love music and designing things as a future engineer I feel like it is essential to comprehend Computer Science to better understand computers. CS can operate hand to hand with engineering as well and can give me more chances to broaden my college opportunities. During this internship, I have a better understanding and a better confidence to work with Computer Science. I know that this knowledge will benefit my resume and portfolio and for personal use. I hope this site can display to all of you how hard I worked and I feel very accomplished during this whole training.</p>
